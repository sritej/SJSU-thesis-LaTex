JavaScript is now-a-days most commonly used as a part of Web Browsers. The main feature of these being the client-side script interacting with the user. On the other side, the same JavaScript is the source of many security problems which includes cross-site scripting attacks and injecting malicious code. The driving factor for all this being the fact that code injected from untrusted sources run with full privileges on the client side thus leading to security breach. We as a part of this paper develop information flow controls with proper exception handling mechanism to prevent violations of data confidentiality and integrity.

Faceted values are a new mechanism to handle dynamic information flow security in a way that it overcomes the limitations caused by the dynamic execution. Sometimes there might be few problems (with implicit flows) where high-security information can be inferred from a programâ€™s flow of control, or sometime the execution might get stuck while transferring this high-security information when there is an exception raised. Faceted values are considered to be the efficient in providing multiple executions for multiple security levels, thus overcoming the problems due to dynamic execution those stated above.
