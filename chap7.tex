\chapter{Conclusion}

We have seen how to achieve termination-insensitive non-interference dynamically in scenarios involving exceptions. Faceted values calculate multiple different views for different security levels while providing a non-interference guarantee. Adding to the existing research on the faceted value approach from previous papers ~\cite{bib3, bib4} that show-cased implementation of JavaScript with faceted values to defend against many security related attacks , this paper shows an experimental implementation of exception handling scenarios without the program being halted abruptly and not leaking any information to the attacker by throwing exceptions when any malicious code is inserted. 

Our performance results clearly show how the faceted value approach outperforms Secure Multi-Execution in many cases, even when exception handling is involved and thus showing a way for much secure JavaScript implementations.
